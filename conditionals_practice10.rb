10. Use a variable to store a number, 
then write a condition that 
prints 5 if the number is greater 
than 80, prints 4 if the number 
is greater than 60, prints 3 
if the number is greater 
than 40, prints 2 if the number 
is greater than 20, and 
prints 1 otherwise (only one 
print statement should occur).
